# Project Images

Upload project screenshots/images here. Each project should have its own folder.

## Folder Structure

Create a folder for each project using the normalized project name:

- **XP Lab**: `xplab_emoryhacks_25_winner/`
- **JobHunter.AI**: `jobhunter_ai/`

## How to Name Folders

The folder name is automatically generated from the project name by:
1. Converting to lowercase
2. Replacing spaces and special characters with underscores
3. Removing leading/trailing underscores

**Example:**
- Project name: "XP Lab (EmoryHacks '25 Winner)"
- Folder name: `xplab_emoryhacks_25_winner`

## Supported Formats

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`
- `.gif`

## How It Works

1. Create a folder inside `public/images/projects/` with the normalized project name
2. Add your project screenshots/images to that folder
3. Images will be automatically loaded and displayed in a 2-column grid below the expanded project details
4. Images are sorted alphabetically by filename

## Tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard.png`, `mobile-view.jpg`)
- Images will be displayed in a 2-column grid with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Keep file sizes reasonable for faster loading
- Recommended: Use PNG for screenshots, JPG for photos
